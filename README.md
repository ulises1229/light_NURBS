# A very small NURBS library

A series of NURBS curve and surface calculation and manipulation tools written in C++

It can be used for

1. Point compute(from parameters to coordinates).
2. Point projection(from coordinates to parameters).
3. NURBS curve and surface fitting, etc.

You can read the examples.

The code may be ugly because it is originally written for personal use.

It depends on OpenCV library and OpenGL as well if you need to run the examples.
